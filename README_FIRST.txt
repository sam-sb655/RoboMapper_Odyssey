RoboMapper Odyssey - Submission Package (Milestone 1)

Thank you for reviewing our project submission for Milestone 1 of RoboMapper Odyssey.

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
------------------------------------------------
1. Extract `milestone1_code.zip` inside a ROS2 Humble workspace.
2. Review `workspace_instructions.txt` for detailed build and launch steps.
3. Refer to `2_Documentation/` for architectural insights, challenges, and visuals.
4. Open `3_Demonstration_Media/` to view recorded demos and RViz interactions.
5. If you encounter errors, refer to `error_logs/installation_failures.txt`.

We were unable to proceed beyond Milestone 1 due to environment storage limitations during live USB deployment.

We hope you appreciate our efforts and the technical depth we achieved in Milestone 1.
